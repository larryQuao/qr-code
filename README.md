## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Internal CSS properties


### What I learned

What I learned doing this project is being able to align the container at the center of the webpage

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="card">
      <img src="/images/image-qr-code.png" alt="image-qr-code">
  
      <h3 class="heading">
        Improve your front-end skills by building projects
      </h3>
  
      <p class="paragraph">
        Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level
      </p>
    </div>
```
```css
.container{
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      height: 100vh;
    }
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue to learn on CSS layout thus display properties, position properties, Alignment properties and related CSS layouts.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp) - This helped me for alignment of the container and elements.
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Center_an_element) - This documentation helped me understand more about centering an element.
